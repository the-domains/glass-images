Church Glass Services

When most people think of a church, many things come to
mind, such as wooden pews, soaring ceilings, a huge organ, and of course,
stained glass. With more than 25 years of experience, we've done our fair share
of combining glass design with sacred architecture. Nothing brings in the light
of God like a beautifully designed and built stained glass window.

Whether you are building a new church structure or want to
add character and design to an older building, we have the resources and
expertise to give you what you need. We've restored over 20,000 antique windows
and will care for your historical windows with the delicate touch required to
make them last another hundred years. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c781f626-3cf8-4bbc-87b4-1182a6f466fd.jpg)
