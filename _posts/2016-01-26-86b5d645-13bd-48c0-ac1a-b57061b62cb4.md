Public Art

Art is a way for people to express themselves and their
culture. Public art is one of the ways that a city or a town can express the
communities' individuality and character to visitors and the rest of the world.
Although many people consider public art to be limited to sculptures in a park
or a fountain near a square, Glass Images and Creations Inc. offers a unique
perspective on public art.

From classical stained glass to custom glass sculptures, we
create public art that would make any community proud. We use lamination
techniques to add safety and strength to each public piece.
